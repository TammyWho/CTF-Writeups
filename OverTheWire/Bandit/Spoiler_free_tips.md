### **Tips for Success:**

1. **Breathe In and Calm Down:**  
   Take a deep breath and stay calm. These challenges can be tricky, but with patience and persistence, you'll get through them!

2. **Read the Challenge Carefully:**  
   Make sure to read the challenge description thoroughly. Sometimes, the answer is hidden in the details, and understanding the task is half the battle.

3. **Visit the Helpful Links:**  
   Don't skip over the helpful resources provided. These are often designed to guide you, so make sure you read and understand them.

4. **Don’t Be Shy to Google:**  
   Googling is a big part of solving CTF challenges. In fact, you'll likely need to search more than you’d expect. Embrace it, and use the wealth of information available to you.

5. **AI Can Be Helpful, But Use It Wisely:**  
   While I don’t recommend relying solely on AI, tools like ChatGPT can be a great resource when you come across commands or concepts that you don’t fully understand. Ask for clarification, but make sure you try to figure things out yourself first.

6. **When Asking for Help, Start with What You've Tried:**  
   If you reach out to others for assistance, whether on Discord, IRC, or elsewhere, be sure to explain what you've already attempted. It shows that you're actively trying, helps others assist you better, and keeps you in the right mindset. 

# Stay calm and don’t give up!
